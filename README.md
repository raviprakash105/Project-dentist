#Project-Dentist
This is a demo project I have created for a dentist's website, where I will market their services. This is a dentist website where I will work on categories and subcategories.

The subcategories are:

X-rays: To diagnose cavities, gum disease, and other issues below the gum line.
Fluoride treatments: To strengthen teeth and prevent decay.
Dental sealants: Applied to the chewing surfaces of molars and premolars to protect them from cavities.
Tooth fillings: Used to repair cavities and prevent further damage.
Crowns: Caps placed over damaged or weakened teeth to restore their function and appearance.
Bridges: Replace missing teeth by anchoring to surrounding teeth.
Partial or Full Dentures: Replace all or a significant number of missing teeth in the upper or lower jaw.
